## Kanye West
Has Kayne lived a perfect life? No. Has he done incredibly stupid things? Yes. But for some reason, I am so inspired by Kanye. His talent is undeniable. He's been absolutely incredible. He releases fantastiac albums, that each have their own flavor and is quite different, yet it remains so good.

I love how he does not care about what people think about him. That's a blessing and a curse. It is what has allowed him to go crazy and do stupid things...but without it, I'm not sure he is where he is.

His talent in producing, writing, and performing is just unmatched. Also, he's not confident, he's atrosishily arrogant. But I love people that are like that, with the talent to back it up. You'll see this trend in my inspirations. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is another very similar.

I loved listening to [Zane Lowe's 2019 interview with Kanye](https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-kanye-west-new-interview-with-zane-lowe/) at his ranch in Wyoming.

One of my favorite quotes Kayne gives:
> > I am unquestionably, undoubtedly, the greatest human artist of all time

I just can't handle the confidence!

## Justin Bieber
I remember years ago when JB got started. iTunes was still a thing and they used to have weekly, free songs. I remember seeing *Baby* and getting it for free. I played it having no idea about the artist, and I thought "Wow, Justin is usually a name for a boy." But after his preteen years, Justin has become an absolute force. His album [Changes](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&sxsrf=ALeKk01EsMvG8ZLj1yZOf9t-8U8KV2cPNA:1592056181215&q=justin+bieber+changes+songs&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLVT9c3NEwrKs6KrzLIU0LlaolmJ1vp55YWZybrJ-YkleZaFefnpRcvYpXOKi0uycxTSMpMTUotUkjOSMxLTy1WAMvuYGUEABTdIURYAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjs7pK59_7pAhUtSjABHblRDQ8QMTAfegQIBhAK&biw=1812&bih=892) is one of my all time favorite albums.

But I really grew admiration for Justin while watching [his min-docu series on YouTUbe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IilZLGt_Ufo). The dude is just so good. He has incredible talent. And has he been perfect? No. But I've really seen a change in him lately and I admire his humility and change in his life.

You can check out an [interview with him by Zane Lowe](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/justin-bieber/id1461515071?i=1000476088421) and learn more about *Changes*
