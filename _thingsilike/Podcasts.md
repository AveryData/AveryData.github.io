  - The interviews with **Kayne West** are so interesting. It's been crazy to see Kayne's life change as he's gone from a wrapper to a *"Christian Innovator"*. I, as a God-believer myself, admire Kayne's desire to follow God. And I also think he's spreading the message of Christ. He is by no means perfect, even now, but I appreciate his efforts.

  His albums are insane and inspiring. One thing I love about Kanye is his swagger. The dude literally says in this show "There is no doubt, I am the greatest artist to ever live" and I just admire that. Is he arrogant? Yes. But I love the confidence he has in himself.

  I also admire how much he ignores what others think of him. You can say what you want but Kanye gonna Kanye. Does he ignore people that are probably right? Yes, probably. But it's also that disregard to those voices that allows him to do amazing things.

  He's crazy, but I love him.

  Idea for a data viz: "Ode To Kanye". Look at his Tweets, look at his lyrics.
