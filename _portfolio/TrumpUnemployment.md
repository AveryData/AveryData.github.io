In a tweet in October 2019, Trump pat himself on the back for the wonderful job he'd been doing to get unemployment to record lows. But I wondered, had he really done that much? How was unemployment trending historically?

Turns out the transition between him and Obama was pretty smooth...and really there isn't any large jumps down during Trump's term as president. If anything, the slope decreases (but I won't let that be a downmark for trump. In all fairness, there is a bottom and 3% might be around that bottom and hence we would asymptote out).

I made this via JMP.
