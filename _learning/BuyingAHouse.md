title: "Buying a House"
excerpt: "What have I learned"
---

I was lucky enough to buy my first house at age 23. My wife was 21. We loved our first house. It was amazing. It was much needed after living as cheap as we could for 4 years.

## What Does A Buying Agent Do?
From my experience, this is what a real estate agent typically does:

1) has you explain what you're looking for
2) set up automatically generated emails to be sent as new properties pop up on the market that match you terms
3) will set up showings and go look at any property with you
4) will point things out you may not realize (might need work here, busy street there)

You can just use the seller's agent, but seller's agents has a fiduciary duty to help the seller.

## Having trouble with your real estate agent?

If you're having issues with your real estate agent, you'll want to read through [these steps](https://www.homelight.com/blog/buyer-how-to-fire-my-real-estate-agent/) before doing anything

## Who Pays Commission
Real estate commission is typically 5-6%. Usually the buying agent and selling agent split the commission to around 3% each.

If you are buying a home, you don't have to pay the real estate agent commission.

If you're selling the home, you pretty much need to pay 6% in commission.


## Signing
Do not sign everything until you understand what in the world is going on.

## What's Included In Closing Costs?



When you're buying, you typically have to pay the earnest money which lets you know you are interested.

Then you get a home inspection (~$500). They tell you everything that is wrong with the house.

Then you get an appraisal (~$500)

What We Are Looking For With A House:

Honestly, the most important thing to us is the price and the location. We'd really like to be max 25 minutes from the Pennock's (160 South 1140 East, Lindon, UT).

We'd also rather live somewhere we can afford more easily, so we can spend more money having fun on vacation. We could do $425k, but I'd rather be in the $300's...Or have a mother in law / apartment.

A garage and a backyard are a must. They both can be small, but just need them.

Not necessary, but nice:
- master closet that isn't tiny
- dual sinks in master



Stuff That You've Sent Us:

To be honest, if the location isn't really ideal (East), I don't think I'd pay over $400. Unless you can convince us other wise. I'm more interested in a less nice house.

$415 new build in AF. I like this one, but the problem is, we'd want to close in january. I don't know if any new builds are going to be done in January so we can close?

https://www.utahrealestate.com/1712891?st_id=133917744&actor=99021
$415 in AF. This one is okay, but I think it's still a big high priced. 20 minutes from the Pennocks






Stuff we've been looking at:

Here are two mother in law's that we looked at and kinda blew in the bidding:

https://www.utahrealestate.com/1709550?st_id=132948656&actor=73830
This was our dream but we got outbid. Great location, mother in law, pretty cheap. $440. The one that got away. It's now sold.

https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/915-S-1680-E-Pleasant-Grove-UT-84062/11910794_zpid/
We also almost went under contract here. Everyone convinced us there were too many projects. We kinda regret it as well. It looks like it is pending though.

These would have been awesome. We sent them to our old realtor but he didn't really do anything. Now they are pending:
- https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/655-S-Mayor-Place-Dr-American-Fork-UT-84003/241989500_zpid/ AF for $375k
- https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/228-W-Silver-Springs-Dr-Vineyard-UT-84059/241990732_zpid/ vineyard for $400k
