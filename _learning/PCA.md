# Principal Component Analysis and the Mighty Multivariate Decomposition

Principal Component Analysis is the primary technique for data compression. It relies heavily upon linear algebra and eigenvectors.


Goals:
1) Make the data set smaller
2) Finding or revealing hidden

Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces N dimensions down.


Examples when to use it:
- Pictures. A simple picture could have millions of pixels, but you can recreate the image with a compressed version that is pretty much the same with only 10% the data load.
