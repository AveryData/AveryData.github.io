## What is manufacturing?
Manufacturing means to "make something on a large scale using machinery". This encompasses many processes included, but not limited to:
- Oil and Gas
- Pharmaceuticals
- Vehicles (cars, planes)
- Consumer goods
- Semiconductors


## How can data science be used?



### Oil and Gas

In oil and gas, you try to find oil in the ground, and turn that oil into a more valuable resource. There are three main processes:

1) Upstream: Getting oil out of the ground

2) Midstream: Transporting the oil from where you got it out of the ground to somewhere else

3) Downstream: Transforming the oil into useful products

Each of these processes can use data science in different ways to provide value and increase efficiency. Sometimes similar methods and techniques can be used in all three processes.
