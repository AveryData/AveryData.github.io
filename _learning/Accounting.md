**Accounting is the study of the measurement and reporting of a financial institution.**


## Financial Statements
Financial reports are a big part of accounting. They should be easy to understand, comparable, timeliness, objective, and full disclosed. Investors/shareholders, creditors (banks), government agencies (SEC), management, and financial analysts all use this report. They typically have 3 sections: 1) Balance Sheet 2) Income Statement 3) Statement of Cash Flow

#### Balance Sheet
The Balance Sheet measures financial position at a point in time. **A snapshot** of the companies finances in a given moment. What it owns, what it owes. Assets, liabilities, and Owner's Equity.

$Assets=Liabilities+OwnersEquity$

##### Assets
Assets are the resources or rights of resources of the company. They can be physical, like buildings, cash, equipment. They could be intangible like trademarks, patents, and copyrights. They could even be legals rights, like legal rights to a payment. Usually these are sorted on the balance sheet by liquidity. The more liquid (closer to cash) something is, the closer to the top it is.

Assets could be worth:
- What you paid for them
- What you could sell it for now
- The cost to replace one
- Accounted for inflation

But generally speaking, on the balance sheet, its accepted to be objective and just take the historical asset cost of what you paid for it.


##### Liabilities
Liabilities are obligations owned to creditors. They can be money, or even goods and services. Includes: deffered revenue, accounts payable, wages payable, dividends payable. Does not include depreciation.

##### Owner's Equity
This represents the residual interest of owners to the assets. If you rearrange the equation, it's the assets subtracted by the liabilities. This becomes retained earnings.

Audits occurs to ensure whether the financial statements are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP. They're concerned with if the numbers provided are given fairly. They say it is unqualified (clean and acceptable), modified (auditor takes exception to something), or adverse (statement is not fair).

The date on a balance sheet shows the financial position on the firm for that date. Remember, balance sheet is a snapshot, not a period. 



## Revenues
Revenues: Value received for goods sold or services provided

## Expenses:
Expenses: Payment or obligations for goods or services rendered.

Cash Accounting only accounts for when **cash** exchanges hands. Accrual Accounting accounts of everything (including the trading of services or goods).

You have an interesting problem when goods are bought in 4Q 2019, but sold in 1Q 2020. The Matching Principle says both the cost and the revenue should go together in Q1 2020.

Currents assets are anything that can turn to cash within the year. They include: cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, pre-paid expenses.



## Income Statement
Income Statement shows a company's operation over time; what happened over a period of time. Usually, it is done yearly.

It basically highlights: $RevenuesEarned - ExpensesIncurred = NetIncome / Profit / Earnings$.

EPS is Earnings per Share. It's the net income / number of shares.

Note that dividends are not included as an expense.

## Statement of Cash Flows
State of Cash flows looks at how a company receives and uses cash. There are three main sections: Operating, investing, and financing.

Cash outflow would capture things like dividends, taxes, interest payments, and salaries. But it would not include depreciation (not cash movement).
