## Color is special
Color calls attention to information, increases the beauty, make it more memorable.


## Best/Easiest Resource
[My current go-to](https://www.colorhexa.com/808080)
Input Hex, RGB, or use color picker...then see complementary, triadic, monochromic schemes, conversions (hex, RGB, HSL, HSV, and a bunch I don't know about) alternatives, shades and tints, tones, even color blindness simulators.

This is made by Cynthia Brewer. She's a good follow on Twitter as well [@ColorBrewer](https://twitter.com/ColorBrewer). She also has a book that looks interesting.


## What do colors mean?

You also have to consider what colors might mean. Red is often negative and maybe shouldn't be used for profits. For instance, red and green as a pair denote Christmas often, they also denote green as good and red as bad.

## Representing Color Digitally
### RGB
RBG is the most common form. It is an additive color model where red, green, and blue lights are mixed to make the different lights.

### HSV
This model is another way of looking at color. H is 'Hue' or color. S is 'Saturation'. And V is 'Lightness'. Hue is the color. Lightness makes it from white to the color. And saturation is from white to black.

## Color Considerate
10% of males and 1% of femals are RG colorblind. You'll wait to make sure the colors you use are visible for are.
