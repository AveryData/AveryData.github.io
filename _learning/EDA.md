## What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
The best data scientist is the person who knows the data inside and out. You truly have to put yourself inside of the data and walk around.

What does it look like? What does it feel like? What does it smell like? 



### Data Viz in EDA
Data visualization plays a huge role!

What does it look like? Look at distributions! Boxplots, histograms, violin plots.

An example where data visualization is key is [Anscombe's Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet). Just because you know the stats doesn't mean you know the data!
