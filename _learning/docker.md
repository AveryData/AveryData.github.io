Docker enables you to deploy an application with all the parts needed (libraries, dependencies, data, ect) and send it out as a single image. Then, any host with docker installed can run that image. Docker container file's system is pretty close to Linux.

Always be sure to run the docker image locally, because then it will for sure work on the cloud.


# Step 1
The first step is making sure you have Docker install.


# Step 2

Make a requirements.txt file

pip freeze > requirements.txt
