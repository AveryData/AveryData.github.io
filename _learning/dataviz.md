Data visualization aids humans to make decisions or explorations.

$7 \pm 2$ is the number of items an average human holds in working memory. -- George Miller, 1956.

Highlight the important parts of complex big data. Data -> Insights.

We are in Big Data, but data is only going to get bigger. That means distilling what is important and giving people a platform to explore will be key. 




Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) meets Data Mining = Data Visualization. Automatic, summaries, and interactive and visualization.

You can highlight the most abnormal or most interesting things, maybe the first 5. Look at these 5 and trust me...but we as humans want to know why and see proof. Hence interactivity can come into play. Usability really matters!

*"Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid. Human beings are incredibly slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. Togehter they are powerful beyond imagination"*
