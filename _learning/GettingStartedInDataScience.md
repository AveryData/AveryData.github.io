## What Is Data Science?
Using any form of data or information to extract insights or value.

## Here are some examples of data science in real life:

## What Are the Different Roles?
There are data scientist, data analysts, business analysts, business intelligence, data engineers, and much more.

There are even specialty roles with data science + a specific domain. Bioinformaticist is when data is used in biology. Pyschometrics is when stats and psychology collide. Chemometrics are chemistry plus data.

## How to Get Started?
How to get started is kind of a hard question. It's like asking, how do you get to Central Park in New York. It all depends where you're at, and where you want to go within Central Park.

If you're starting in Miami, Florida, it's going to take you a long time to get to Central Park and you might take a car, a plane, and a bus to get there. If you're starting on Staten Island, you could be there in an hour via boat. If you're in the Upper East Side, you could just walk there in 15 minutes.

So, where are you right now? And where do you think you want to go?

Think about what experiences you currently have and what you want to do more of.

I would say for people who are more interested in data analyst and business intelligence, learning Tableau is the place to start.

Anything more involved (data scientist / engineer / any specialty), you're probably going to need to gain data wrangling and model making skills. These involve programming. If you don't know how to program, you'll want to start there. Python and R are the two languages most common in the data world. I personally suggest starting with Python. I think it is easier and more flexible and similar to other languages.

SQL and data bases is another overall good thing to learn.


## Start Where You Are
The best way to get into data science is to use it right where you are. You don't have to have the title of data scientist to use data science. How can data help you in your job right now? How can it help the company you work for?

Like any position, it's hard to get a job when you don't have experience. One of the ways to play the system is have someone who trusts you. Your current job trusts you and is more likely to give you a data science role, even when you maybe don't have all that much experience.

## Start Learning On Your Own

Visit [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) and read a story daily. This will help you understand the industry and what is possible, and how people are doing it.

Check out [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/) and poke around. Look at their competitions and see some of the winners or most highly upvoted notebooks.

Study the concepts of the [Boston Housing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) problem and learn regression.

Focus on the techniques behind [The Titanic Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and learn classificaiton.

## Personal Projects
The best way to learn is by doing, so start doing.

Find something you're interested in, and do something data science-y about it.
