You can add a code block. I think that just displays code on your site. [See Code Block](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/code-block/)


To see the code go to the code editor. You click the 3 dots in the upper right, go to 'Editor', and select 'Code Editor'. I learned that from [wpbuffs article](https://wpbuffs.com/edit-source-code-in-wordpress/). You can also add custom html.
