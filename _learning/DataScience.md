## Data Analytics
Data Analytics can be divided into 4 main sections:

Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive.

1) Descriptive Analytics: tells you what's happened in the past

2) Diagnostic Analytics: helps you understand why something happened in the past

3) Predictive Analytics: predicts what is most likely to happen in the future

4) Prescriptive Analytics: recommends actions you can take to affect outcomes

ðŸ¦  Here's an example: I'm trying to get hand sanitizer during the pandemic.

Descriptive analytics would tell me that from March 15th - April 15th, 89% of stores ran out of their sanitizer supply.

Diagnostic analytics would tell me they ran out because there was an enormous spike in hygiene and germ spreading due to the outbreak of #CoronaVirus

Predictive analytics would predict the likelihood of my nearest grocery store having sanitizer in stock.

Prescriptive analytics would recommend a time, place, and plan to obtain the needed sanitizer.
