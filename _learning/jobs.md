## Small vs Big Company



## Where to find jobs?

[LinkedIn.com] has a lot of great jobs. The EasyApply make it especially easy to apply to many jobs quickly. I'm a big fan of LinkedIn so I find myself using this quite a bit.

[https://stackoverflow.com/jobs] is pretty powerful for software/developer jobs. I like it because the filters are really built for my needs. There's a *background* filter that let's you put the role you're interested in. That tag also allows for min and max experience needed as well as job type (full-time, contract, internship). There's a *remote* toggle directly (which I love).  

[angel.co] has start up company positions open. These can include equity, stock shares, or other perks.

[GlassDoor.com] has some good jobs. I also think they have the best salary and interview question checker.

[Harnham](https://www.harnham.com/us/jobs?options=1111) does Data Science recruiting and have some higher paying positions.

[Find Y2 Combinator Jobs](https://workatastartup.com/) and work for the next Uber, AirBnB, ect.
