## Medium is awesome
I'm not a Medium expert, but I really like it. It is an online news publication for various subjects. No ads. The claim their mission is:
> > Our sole purpose is to help you find compelling ideas, knowledge, and perspectives

There are all sorts of topics.


## TowardsDataScience
My favorite in all things data is the *Towards Data Science*. It focuses on things like data science, machine learning, programming, AI, and visualization.

[Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)

If you want to learn how to submit an article for the publication, [read this intro.](https://towardsdatascience.com/questions-96667b06af5).

## Nightingale
I'm not as familiar with Nightingale, but it is the publication journal that accompanies [The Data Viz Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/).
