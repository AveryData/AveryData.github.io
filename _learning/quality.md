## What is quality?
Meeting or exceeding customers expectations.

### Garvin's 8 Dimensions of Product Quality:
1) Performance - operating characteristics - how fast does a car go? mpg?
2) Functionality - supplemental attributes - not necessary, but nice. Movies on a plane, stereo/gps in car
3) Durability - how long does it last -
4) Reliability - will this product work when you want it to - will your car start on a cold day
5) Conformance - does it reach specs? - is the gas at the right octane?
6) Serviceability - how easy is it to maintain and service a product -
7) Aesthetics - how does it look? - is it sexy? is it alluring?
8) Perceived Quality - does the customer think it is nice? - Company reputation. "I'm a Ford guy"

##### Other Quality
- Consistancy: If I go to other locations or if I go to multiple times, or on different days of the week, are they the same. Think McDonald's. Has to be the same everywhere.
- Courtesy: Think Chick-Fil-A's "My Pleasure"
- Convenience/Availability: Think banks not being available outside 8-4.
- Communication: Is the customer kept up to date?
- Timeliness: Can you be fast to my needs? Are you quick?
- Trustworthiness: Can I trust you? do you bill me for only the right things?
- Security: Do I feel safe? Do I feel risks?
