# Ways To Engage Audiences

# Questions
The best questions is, "Where are you watching from?" Complex questions don't get that good of a response. Make questions simple and easy. "Know what I mean", or "Type 'y' if you feel me".

# Curiosity
Give them a benefit for sticking around the whole time.

# Agenda
Remention the agenda often so that people who leave and come can know what's going on

# Speak directly to viewers
Calling audience members out by name is a great way to make them feel part of it.

# Answering Questions
If you can get people to ask questions, and then answer them, you're golden.
