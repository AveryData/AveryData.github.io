## Finding a Name For Your Business
Your business name is key. It's important for brand, for SEO, for impressions. You got to have a good name.

- [Namelix](https://namelix.com/) is probably my favorite. You can choose keywords, a length, and name style

## Website Building
How do you choose a website?

"WordPress has more SEO power, but Squarespace is better for beginners and in-house tools. By installing SEO plugins on WordPress, you can choose powerful tools like Yoast. But if you want built-in features and much less work, then Squarespace is the better choice" -- [article](https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/website-builders/comparisons/squarespace-vs-wordpress/#:~:text=WordPress%20has%20more%20SEO%20power,Squarespace%20is%20the%20better%20choice.)


#### Pricing
- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/pricing/): Personal $4 (still has wordpress ads), Premium $8 (still has the wordpress logo), Business $25 (200 GB storage), eCommerce $45
- [Wix](https://www.wix.com/upgrade/website): Personal $14 (domain, no ads, 3GB, 30 minutes of vid), Entrepreneurs $18 (10GB, 1 Hour Video, ad vouchers), Pro $23 (20GB, 2 hours video, logo and social media logo files)


## Finding a Logo For Your Business

- [Looka](Looka.com) is incredible. You can say your business name and choose some icons that represent your business and they autogenerate everything. They have a comprehensive package that gives you everything you'd ever need. But it costs $5 for the basic plan and $8 for the Premium. Does seem like you can download everything and then cancel and retain the rights.

- [Canva](canva.com) is pretty good. They are $10-$13/month for Pro. It includes a lot though.

## Icons
Flat Icon is good, but most need attribution.

[UxWing](https://uxwing.com/?s=ecommerce) looks like no strings attache!


## Whiteboard Software to Explain Concepts

- [Explain Everything](https://drive.explaineverything.com/) is a cool, free whiteboarding app where you can just explain ideas to others, or create a video an voice recording explaining something more complex.

## Illustrations
- [MixKit](https://mixkit.co/free-stock-art/discover/work/) has free illustrations, music, sound effects.
