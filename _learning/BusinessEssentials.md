## Finding a Name For Your Business
Your business name is key. It's important for brand, for SEO, for impressions. You got to have a good name.

- [Namelix](https://namelix.com/) is probably my favorite. You can choose keywords, a length, and name style




## Finding a Logo For Your Business

- [Looka](Looka.com) is incredible. You can say your business name and choose some icons that represent your business and they autogenerate everything.


## Whiteboard Software to Explain Concepts

- [Explain Everything](https://drive.explaineverything.com/) is a cool, free whiteboarding app where you can just explain ideas to others, or create a video an voice recording explaining something more complex.
