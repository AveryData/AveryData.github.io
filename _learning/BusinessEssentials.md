## Finding a Name For Your Business
Your business name is key. It's important for brand, for SEO, for impressions. You got to have a good name.

- [Namelix](https://namelix.com/) is probably my favorite. You can choose keywords, a length, and name style






## Invoicing

Can collect via PayPal or via secure bank payment (ACH/EFT).

### Electronic Funds Transfer
Electronic Funds Transfer (ETF) is probably the best way. It is from one bank account to another. Both banks require transactions fees which can be costly. ACH is automatic clearing house. It is a way to move money between banks without checks or wires, or credit cards.

### Upwork Direct Contracts
Upwork lets you create contracts and collect payments using [Upwork Direct Contracts](https://www.upwork.com/ab/flservices/contracts/). This works for fixed projects and hourly wages.

- Secure payment before project. Protected in escrow.
- Fee is 3.4% of contract. No fee for client.
- Mediation available.


### Zoho
[Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/us/invoice/pricing/) has a free plan, $9 plan, $19 plan, and $29 plan. Honestly the free looks fine except it only has up 5 customers...I wonder if that's 5 current customers?

## Quick Books
[Quick Books](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/pricing/?sc=seq_intuit_qb_click_prod_featured_independence_day) has a lot. But it is $25/month. Looks like you can manage 1099 contractors though and do tax deductions, and incoive and accept payments.

### Invoice Ninja
There's a free version, or a $10/month version

### Wave
Wow a lot is free. Payments are 2.9% of credit card.

### PayPal
2.9% + $0.30 fee.

### Bonsai
[Bonsai](https://www.hellobonsai.com/) is an all in one replacement that does proposals, contracts, projects, time tracking, expenses, invoices, tasks, accounting and taxes.

Looks like it is $19/month or $30/month. The more expensive includes subcontracting

## IRS 1099
A 1099 form is a record that an entity or person other than your employer gave or paid you money. The payer fills out the 1099 sends copies to you and the IRS.

Often freelancers and independent contractors get a 1099 from their clients. The form reflects the money the client has paid the freelancer or independent contractor.

The 1099-MISC is the one that is important and it's basically a free lancer's W2.

Client does not withhold taxes from you. But you still have to pay them. Your client is required to send you a 1099-MISC form if he or she paid you $600 or more in the previous year

W2 is for employees. W-9 is for contractors, get all their information.

A W-9 form is used by the IRS to gather information about an independent contractor so that their earnings can be reported at the end of the year. On the other hand, a 1099 form is the paperwork used to report how much that contractor earned at the end of the year.

See [this site](https://learn.g2.com/w9-vs-1099#:~:text=A%20W%2D9%20form%20is,the%20end%20of%20the%20year.)

If you ever pay a contractor more than $600, you will need to issue them a 1099-MISC as per instructions. It’s important when contracting with others to get them to fill out the proper form, in this case a W-9, which has the information you’ll need for issuing a 1099 tax form.

## Website Building
How do you choose a website?

"WordPress has more SEO power, but Squarespace is better for beginners and in-house tools. By installing SEO plugins on WordPress, you can choose powerful tools like Yoast. But if you want built-in features and much less work, then Squarespace is the better choice" -- [article](https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/website-builders/comparisons/squarespace-vs-wordpress/#:~:text=WordPress%20has%20more%20SEO%20power,Squarespace%20is%20the%20better%20choice.)


#### Pricing

## Starting an LLC
LLC, or Limited Liability Company, is a business structure where business owners are not held liable for company debts. It keeps your personal assets, such as your house, vehicle, and savings account, safe if your LLC declares bankruptcy or is sued.

Single-member LLC's are pass-through entities so the profits and losses are pass to you and taxed as personal income. That's nice because you don't have to pay corporate and personal income tax on that.

This [website](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/15748-how-to-start-llc.html) does a pretty good job explaining it all.

### Other Organization Structures
**C Corporations** are taxed as separate entities. Most C companies are publicly traded.

**S Corporations** also do not have double taxation, and they also protect you from legal issues. It preserves the limited liability that comes from a C corporation but also keeps the pass-through tax set up.  

**Sole Proprietorship** is a type of business structure where you and your business share an identity. If the company is sued, the personal belongings are at risk.


### Choosing the State
The most logical is where you will operate the LLC, especially if you have a storefront or office. But you can have foreign state LLC's. Delaware and Nevada have business friendly laws


## Finding a Logo For Your Business

- [Looka](Looka.com) is incredible. You can say your business name and choose some icons that represent your business and they autogenerate everything. They have a comprehensive package that gives you everything you'd ever need. But it costs $5 for the basic plan and $8 for the Premium. Does seem like you can download everything and then cancel and retain the rights.

- [Canva](canva.com) is pretty good. They are $10-$13/month for Pro. It includes a lot though.

## Icons
Flat Icon is good, but most need attribution.

[UxWing](https://uxwing.com/?s=ecommerce) looks like no strings attache!


## Whiteboard Software to Explain Concepts

- [Explain Everything](https://drive.explaineverything.com/) is a cool, free whiteboarding app where you can just explain ideas to others, or create a video an voice recording explaining something more complex.

## Illustrations
- [MixKit](https://mixkit.co/free-stock-art/discover/work/) has free illustrations, music, sound effects.
