## How Big is Big Data?
Big data? Some say it starts with *Petabytes* which is 1000x of a *terabyte*. It can even be bigger! exabyte or bigger.

FB has about 0.5 PB of data a day. Avatar's 3D effects were 1 PB.


## How To Store Big Data
How do you store this much data? Your own machine? Well, SeaGate did just announce a 60TB single drive. If it's bigger than that (or if you don't have as big as computer), you'll have to use a cluster of machine.

## Concerns With Cluster
- How many machines to have?
- What happens if a computer dies? All of them will eventually. 
- Should we back everything up?
