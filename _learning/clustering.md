Cluster is an unsupervised machine learning method that involves grouping data into natural groupings. 

It is useful when you want to see the underlying structure of a data set. 

It'll show what points are similar to others. It's also useful in potential outlier detection. 

An example use case would be segmenting customers into groups to advertise.
