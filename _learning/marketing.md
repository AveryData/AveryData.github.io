## What Is Marketing?
Marketing is the creation and satisfaction of demand for a product or service.

Advertising is just a component of marketing.

*Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs.* -- Peter Drucker

*The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product sells itself* -- Peter Drucker

Marketing Strategy is specifying a target market and related marketing mix.

Traditional advertising is sold at cost per thousand.

$CPM = Cost Per Mille (Thousand)$

But it also has subgroups, usually by age.

## 5 C's

### Customers
Potential buyers with wants and needs that the company aims to fulfill. They are the focal point.

### Company
Organization of business unit providing certain goods or services.

### Competitors
Organizations that try to fill the same needs of the same customers you are aiming for. Porter's Five Forces. Have to be different than others, otherwise you're a commodity and it is just the cheapest price.

### Collaborators

### Context

You have to first learn about it. Understand why it's interesting. Start paying. Market to specific customers that you already have. Convince existing customers to buy again. Satisfy your customer so much they share and market for you.

## Buyer Journey
Discovery. Consideration. Decision.


###### What brands do you advocate for? Why?

## Customer Profile / Personas

## Mass Marketing
Everyone is the same and everyone is a potential Customer

## Target Marketing
Very specific.


#### Rating
Rating is the percentage of people who own TV's who are tuned into the program.

$Rating = \frac{Number People on Chanel}{Total People With TV's}$

#### HUT
HUT = Household Using Television: Percentage of TV's on right now.

$\frac{Total People With TV on}{Total People with TV's}$

#### Share
Share is percentage of people watching *now* that are tuned into the program.

$Share = \frac{Number People on Chanel}{Total People With TV on}$


#### DMA

    $GRP = \Sigma (HouseWatched \cdot Times Watched)$

#### Reach
Reach is how many houses you reached that week

#### Frequency
The average number of viewers.

$Frequency = \frac{GRPs}{Reach}$

## Digital Advertising
- Display Advertising - banner ads on websites
- Search Engine Marketing (SEM) - location on a search engine
- Social Media Marketing - sponsored posts on FB, Instagram, Twitter
- Mobile advertising - on your phone, can be location based
- Email Marketing
- Direct Messaging

Digital advertising is increasing, a lot! Programmatic Digital Advertising has doubled in the last 5 years and in 2019 accounted for 84% of ad spending.

Advertising appears free to the consumer, but it is actually very valuable and costly to the company.

#### PPC
Pay per click (PPC) means the advertiser only pays for each click of their advertisement.

#### CTR
Click through Rate (CTR) is the total clicks divide by the total times the ad was shown.

#### Fixed Costs / Flat Rate
Just one constant cost based on time interval.

#### CPM
Cost Per Mile (CPM) is the cost for 1k impressions

#### CPV
Cost per view (CPV) is the cost of an actual view of an ad

#### CPC
Cost per click

#### CPA/CPL
Cost per acquisition or per lead

#### CPS
Cost per sale

#### CRO
CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization): How to we convert more users to our product? Increase traffic, increase quality of leads, increase leads, grow sales,

### Performance-based adversiting
Purchaser pays only when there are measureable results. Becoming more popular with the spread of digital marketing.


As a company, the riskiest thing is to pay CPM (click per 1k) with the safest being CPS (click per sale). Think about it, you don't pay anything until it is sold! I guess that's why the Amazon affiliate program exists and your content is basically CPS for amazon.

### Display Advertising
Think banner ads, square adds, any ad that is on the margins of a website, or at the top/bottom of an app.

Low click-through rates because many of us are good at blanking out adds and focusing only on the content we want. Works well if contextual (fit with page) theme. Good for branding (get your colors, name, and logo out there). Works even better with retargeting (you were looking at these shoes before, well here they are again).

There are different sizes and locations on the page and hence some combinations are better than others.

Things that are tracked:
- Impressions
- Clicks
- Time of Day
- Device/OS
- Region

Low click through rates.

You always want to advertise on a website that involves on what you are itnerested in.

The top isn't the best place to have them. Research shows right at the folder.

Taking all senses and using them in copy typically peform better.

It's always goodto keep them interactive and excited.

### Dynamic Creative Optimization:
You can put the home team on the helmets for the NFL ad.

### Contextual Ads
This is when a display ad matches the text within the website.

### Search Engine Marketing
Accounts for half of revenue of digital advertising spending. Bing, Google, Yahoo, Baidu are some examples.

You usually have a section dedicated to *paid* ads and then some *organic* links.

Ad formats usually have headline 1, headline 2, ad indicator, primary domain, description. Often these different ads are A/B tested with different versions. A lot of trial error / analytics / ad campaigns to find what works best.  

##### SERP = Search Engine Results Page
The page that shows the results of a search on a search engine. Your position on the SERP really affects your click-through rate. Usually, if you're ranked 1, you have a CTR ~20% and by the time you get to 6th, you fall to ~5%.

##### Landing page
The first page the search engine takes you to when clicking on a link. The goal is to have the best page content for the actual search.

A good landing page is relevant to the search with a very visible call to action. Keep the goal on the user to convert at the front of their mind.

You can create landing pages programmatically in an attempt to give very personalized pages for the thousands of keywords you may be using.

##### Keyword
A word found in a search query that brings a page up

##### Bounce Rate
Percentage of visitors who enter teh site and then leave rather than continue to view other pages.

#### Vickrey Auction Model
Space on the SERP has an auction model. Company A, B and C say I'll pay X, Y, Z as my most expensive ad, and hence they outbid eachother at 1cent more than the lowest spot.

Someone like google often decides through this:

$CPC MaxBid x Quality Score = AdRank/Position$


### Social Media
Everyone and their dog (literally) is on social media. Lots of eyes = lots of advertising opportunity. Some things to remember. 65% of people are visual learners. 8 seconds is the average attention span. People see 3,000 brands a day. You want to create a community. You want to have a dialogue and have others participate.

## Resources to know
- Nielsen Audience Planner
- Google analytics
- Google Adwords
- Facebook ads
- Lots others

## Websites are the center pieces of business
- Product/Services sale
- Brand awareness
- Lead generation

## Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
How much a customer spends over a lifetime. This is very valuable! Some businesses might not be interested in one sale, but hundreds of sales from one person.

## Marketing Mix - 4's
The controllable variables the company provides to satisfy the target market.

Product. Place. Promotion. Price.

Product: What are the benefits of this product to a consumer

Place: Get the right place to the right customer to the right place in the right quantity and right condition.  

Promotion: Personal selling via direct to consumer communication. Mass selling is to everyone via advertising and publicity (earned media). Sales promotions are used to stimulate trial or interest.

Price: Competition, discounts, flexibility, objectives.

## Segmentation
Segmentation is defining markets and knowing what dimensions to use. It's an aggregating process that clusters similar users to a group. The segment should be big enough to be profitable.

Always think I am solving the customer's needs.

Customer needs. Customer types. Geographic Area. Product type.

Demographics are often the starting. Income is key, gender, age, family size, occupation, education, ethnicity, and social class.

Geographic are also key. The region of the world, region in country, size of city, ect can be used.

Behavioral dimensions are also used. What needs they have, the benefits sought, thoughts to survey questions, kind of shopping, ect.

Qualifying Dimensions must be releveant to a customer type. Identify the core features that have to be available to everyone.

Determining Dimensions affect the customer. Can be further segmented.


CRM = Customer Relationship Managements. Predict the needs and desires of customers.



## Search Engine Optimization

### Social and Mobil SEO
Social media shares are important for SEO. Some estimates believe it can be up to 7% of the ranking algorithm.

- How often your links are founds on social media helps your page rank.

- Your social pages are usually boosted by the algorithm and gives the user multiple of your own listings on the first page.

- Social search engines (think Pinterest)

- Social Personalization: if you've or your friends have liked that stuff before, more likely to show for you.


Note that mobile is now 60% of Google searches, and it is growing. Google has said previously that sites that didn't support mobile version would be penalized in all searches. Having a mobile site means you're a good site and you're dedicated to good browser experience. Previously, there were dual URLS, one for desktop and one for mobile. The mobile just added a "M." prefix to the URL. That was a big head ache to have to manage two sites, now dynamic serving is more common. Responsive design is the best option, it is where HTML and CSS is always the same. Responsive design is today's gold standard.

Reducing page load time is also very important.

Make sure that the text is easy to read. Big fonts, clear color contrast, lots of white space, and good pictures.

Having social share buttons on the page encourage viewers to easly share with someone else.



### Keyword Research
How to select keywords to optimize for.

1) Search Volume - how frequently these terms are searched.
2) Relevant - likelihood someone might convert from visiting.
3) Competitive Analysis



### Paid Search

Google is the dominant search engine.

Paid ads have a:
1) Headline (maybe Headline 2)

2) Primary Domain

3) Description

URL's can be pretty complicated and lengthy, so sometimes you have a vanity URL that is more sleek.

Descriptions should have a call to action.

There are these things called Ad Extensions.
Here are some examples:
- Location Extensions: can list the business pysical address.
- Call Extensions: adds the phone number of a business to encourage calls.
- Site Links Extension: adds serveral page links of the site into the ad
- Cal Out Extension: extra text for a call to action.
- Price Extension: shows different card of prices to a specific product page.
- App Extension: a link to the business app from within the SE.

You can even have dynamic keyword insertion. For instance, if someone googles "Cheese Pizza", and you're a pizza company. You can put that word INSIDE your copy, automatically.

To get an advertisement, you go through a bidding system. You give a maximum bid price. Your bid price is NOT your Cost Per Click. Your pay price is one cent off the second place finisher.

Google makes money when people click the ads. That's why they're very convered about relevance and quality. That's why they made this term called quality score. It is based off of:
1) Keyword Relevance: Is the site's keywords matched to the users Google search.This includes being in the broader context of the search...that's good, but the more specific, the higher you might rank.
2) Ad Copy: The search engine is analyzing the actual text inside the ad to see how relevant it is. Exact or phrase matches are being checked.
3) Landing Page: Search engine is checking the relavance on the landing page. It should have similar key words for the users search query.

It is a secret the exact split, but it's pretty close to 33, 33, 33 splits.

There are different categories of keywords. For instance, you can target:

- **Branded Terms:** This is when you use an actual brand name in the key word. For instance, "Under Armour" or "Under Armour shoes".
- **Generic Terms:** This is when you just use a very broad descriptor for the industry. For instance, "running shoes", or "performance apparel".
- **Related Terms:** Terms that are related but not the term. These are searches where the people who search this would also be interested in your product. This is like "treadmills" or "running club".
- **Competitor Terms:** Using a rival's word in your keyword campaign. Like "Nike Running Shoes", or "Adidas Footwear"

### Volume
You have to also think about Volume. You'll want to make decisions knowing how frequent a term is used.

Long tails in search, or very specific Google searches, don't have many searches, but you could capitalize being VERY specifically answering their question.

### Competitive Analysis
Determine who the competitors are. Look at their ad copy and ad structure to try to see how they are reaching out to the customers.



- Broad Match: Includes phrases containing our keyword, with any form of misspellings, stemming, and synonyms.
- Broad Match Modifier: Basically the broad match, but we specify extra words. I.E. +shoes.
- Phrase Match: Search phrases containing your keywords, in the same order, and other words.
- Exact Match: Searches phrases with exact match in same order.
- Negative Match: Words that won't be used. For instance, you are selling shoes, but they are running shoes, not church shoes.  

### Targeting

We can target on a few parameters.

#### Location
Location can be used via geo targeting.

#### Language
We can specify what language they are using

#### Previous Behavior
If they've visted out website beofre.

#### Demographics
Gender, age, income can be used to target certain users.


## Launching a Campaign
Usually there is the account which is the top umbrella that holds all things ads.

Then there is the campaigns which represents different goals and strategies. With a campaign, there are Ad Groups and these have something in common, like a subject.

### Steps in a Good Campaign

1) Define business goals and conduct market research
2) Define business objectives and metrics for success
3) Create a budget that fits for the plan
4) Conduct keyword research.
5) Create ads (header, description, url path)
6) Launch by placing bids
7) Measure and analyze results

## Customer Journey

### Discovery

### Consideration

### Decision

## Break Even Point
Profitablity for a campaign depends on lots of points. We can use the provider's data, 3rd party data, or our own data. Or we can think through a large range of CTR so see if it still makes sense.

Average CPC / Converstion Rate = Customer Acquisition cost.

BEP CPC = Profit Margin * Converstion Rate
