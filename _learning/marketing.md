## What Is Marketing?
Marketing is the creation and satisfaction of demand for a product or service.

Advertising is just a component of marketing.

*Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs.* -- Peter Drucker

*The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product sells itself* -- Peter Drucker

Marketing Strategy is specifying a target market and related marketing mix.

Traditional advertising is sold at cost per thousand.

But it also has subgroups, usually by age.

## 5 C's

### Customers
Potential buyers with wants and needs that the company aims to fulfill. They are the focal point.

### Company
Organization of business unit providing certain goods or services.

### Competitors
Organizations that try to fill the same needs of the same customers you are aiming for. Porter's Five Forces. Have to be different than others, otherwise you're a commodity and it is just the cheapest price.

### Collaborators
External business entities that work with the company to create value for the customers. Raw material suppliers, distributors, marketing agencies, retailers.  

### Context
Environment the business operates like laws, cultural, economic conditions. PESTEL analysis.



## Life Line
Awareness -> Engagement -> Acquisition -> Segmentation -> Retention -> Support

You have to first learn about it. Understand why it's interesting. Start paying. Market to specific customers that you already have. Convince existing customers to buy again. Satisfy your customer so much they share and market for you.

## Buyer Journey
Discovery. Consideration. Decision.


###### What brands do you advocate for? Why?

## Customer Profile / Personas
It's always good to come up with a person you're trying to sell to. Give them a name. Find their pain points.


## Mass Marketing
Everyone is the same and everyone is a potential Customer

## Target Marketing
Very specific.


#### Rating
Rating is the percentage of people who own TV's who are tuned into the program.

$Rating = \frac{Number People on Chanel}{Total People With TV's}$

#### HUT
HUT = Household Using Television: Percentage of TV's on right now.

$\frac{Total People With TV on}{Total People with TV's}$

#### Share
Share is percentage of people watching *now* that are tuned into the program.

$Share = \frac{Number People on Chanel}{Total People With TV on}$


#### DMA
Direct Marketing Organization or Area

#### GRP
GRP is Gross Rating Points = Weekly sum of all house sessions that happened.

    $GRP = \Sigma (HouseWatched \cdot Times Watched)$

#### Reach
Reach is how many houses you reached that week

#### Frequency
The average number of viewers.

$Frequency = \frac{GRPs}{Reach}$

## Digital Advertising
- Display Advertising - banner ads on websites
- Search Engine Marketing (SEM) - location on a search engine
- Social Media Marketing - sponsored posts on FB, Instagram, Twitter
- Mobile advertising - on your phone, can be location based
- Email Marketing
- Direct Messaging

Digital advertising is increasing, a lot! Programmatic Digital Advertising has doubled in the last 5 years and in 2019 accounted for 84% of ad spending.

Advertising appears free to the consumer, but it is actually very valuable and costly to the company.

#### PPC
Pay per click (PPC) means the advertiser only pays for each click of their advertisement

#### CTR
Click through Rate (CTR) is the total clicks divide by the total times the ad was shown

#### Fixed Costs / Flat Rate
Just one constant cost based on time interval.

#### CPM
Cost Per Mile (CPM) is the cost for 1k impressions

#### CPV
Cost per view (CPV) is the cost of an actual view of an ad

#### CPC
Cost per click

#### CPA/CPL
Cost per acquisition or per lead

#### CPS
Cost per sale

#### CRO
CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization): How to we convert more users to our product? Increase traffic, increase quality of leads, increase leads, grow sales,

### Performance-based adversiting
Purchaser pays only when there are measureable results. Becoming more popular with the spread of digital marketing.


As a company, the riskiest thing is to pay CPM (click per 1k) with the safest being CPS (click per sale). Think about it, you don't pay anything until it is sold! I guess that's why the Amazon affiliate program exists and your content is basically CPS for amazon.

### Display Advertising
Think banner ads, square adds, any ad that is on the margins of a website, or at the top/bottom of an app.

Low click-through rates because many of us are good at blanking out adds and focusing only on the content we want. Works well if contextual (fit with page) theme. Good for branding (get your colors, name, and logo out there). Works even better with retargeting (you were looking at these shoes before, well here they are again).

There are different sizes and locations on the page and hence some combinations are better than others.

Things that are tracked:
- Impressions
- Clicks
- Time of Day
- Device/OS
- Region


### Search Engine Marketing
Accounts for half of revenue of digital advertising spending. Bing, Google, Yahoo, Baidu are some examples.

You usually have a section dedicated to *paid* ads and then some *organic* links.

Ad formats usually have headline 1, headline 2, ad indicator, primary domain, description. Often these different ads are A/B tested with different versions. A lot of trial error / analytics / ad campaigns to find what works best.  

##### SERP = Search Engine Results Page
Your position on the SERP really affects your click-through rate. Usually, if you're ranked 1, you have a rate ~20% and by the time you get to 6th, you fall to ~5%.

##### Landing page
Page the search engine takes you to

##### Keyword
A word found in a search query that brings a page up

##### Bounce Rate
Percentage of visitors who enter teh site and then leave rather than continue to view other pages.

#### Vickrey Auction Model
Space on the SERP has an auction model. Company A, B and C say I'll pay X, Y, Z as my most expensive ad, and hence they outbid eachother at 1cent more than the lowest spot.

Someone like google often decides through this:

$CPC MaxBid x Quality Score = AdRank/Position$


### Social Media
Everyone and their dog (literally) is on social media. Lots of eyes = lots of advertising opportunity. Some things to remember. 65% of people are visual learners. 8 seconds is the average attention span. People see 3,000 brands a day. You want to create a community. You want to have a dialogue and have others participate.

## Resources to know
- Nielsen Audience Planner
- Google analytics
- Google Adwords
- Facebook ads
- Lots others

## Websites are the center pieces of business
- Product/Services sale
- Brand awareness
- Lead generation

## Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
How much a customer spends over a lifetime. This is very valuable! Some businesses might not be interested in one sale, but hundreds of sales from one person.

## Marketing Mix - 4's
The controllable variables the company provides to satisfy the target market.

Product. Place. Promotion. Price.

Product: What are the benefits of this product to a consumer

Place: Get the right place to the right customer to the right place in the right quantity and right condition.  

Promotion: Personal selling via direct to consumer communication. Mass selling is to everyone via advertising and publicity (earned media). Sales promotions are used to stimulate trial or interest.

Price: Competition, discounts, flexibility, objectives.

## Segmentation
Segmentation is defining markets and knowing what dimensions to use. It's an aggregating process that clusters similar users to a group. The segment should be big enough to be profitable.

Always think I am solving the customer's needs.

Customer needs. Customer types. Geographic Area. Product type.

Demographics are often the starting. Income is key, gender, age, family size, occupation, education, ethnicity, and social class.

Geographic are also key. The region of the world, region in country, size of city, ect can be used.

Behavioral dimensions are also used. What needs they have, the benefits sought, thoughts to survey questions, kind of shopping, ect.

Qualifying Dimensions must be releveant to a customer type. Identify the core features that have to be available to everyone.

Determining Dimensions affect the customer. Can be further segmented.


CRM = Customer Relationship Managements. Predict the needs and desires of customers.
