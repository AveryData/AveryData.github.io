## Traditional Advertising
  - billboards
  - physical distribution of pamphlets
  - direct mail
  - radio
  - television

  Traditional advertising is decreasing while digital advertising is increasing.

Traditional advertising is sold at cost per thousand.

$CPM = Cost Per Mille (Thousand)$

But it also has subgroups, usually by age.

#### Rating
Rating is the percentage of people who own TV's who are tuned into the program.

$Rating = \frac{Number People on Chanel}{Total People With TV's}$

#### HUT
HUT = Household Using Television: Percentage of TV's on right now.

$\frac{Total People With TV on}{Total People with TV's}$

#### Share
Share is percentage of people watching *now* that are tuned into the program.

$Share = \frac{Number People on Chanel}{Total People With TV on}$


#### DMA
Direct Marketing Organization or Area

#### GRP
GRP is Gross Rating Points = Weekly sum of all house sessions that happened.

    $GRP = \Sigma (HouseWatched \cdot Times Watched)$

#### Reach
Reach is how many houses you reached that week

#### Frequency
The average number of viewers.

$Frequency = \frac{GRPs}{Reach}$

## Digital Advertising
- Display Advertising - banner ads on websites
- Search Engine Marketing (SEM) - location on a search engine
- Social Media Marketing - sponsored posts on FB, Instagram, Twitter
- Mobile advertising - on your phone, can be location based
- Email Marketing
- Direct Messaging

Digital advertising is increasing, a lot! Programmatic Digital Advertising has doubled in the last 5 years and in 2019 accounted for 84% of ad spending.

Advertising appears free to the consumer, but it is actually very valuable and costly to the company.

#### PPC
Pay per click (PPC) means the advertiser only pays for each click of their advertisement

#### CTR
Click through Rate (CTR) is the total clicks divide by the total times the ad was shown

#### Fixed Costs / Flat Rate
Just one constant cost based on time interval.

#### CPM
Cost Per Mile (CPM) is the cost for 1k impressions

#### CPV
Cost per view (CPV) is the cost of an actual view of an ad

#### CPC
Cost per click

#### CPA/CPL
Cost per acquisition or per lead

#### CPS
Cost per sale

As a company, the riskiest thing is to pay CPM (click per 1k) with the safest being CPS (click per sale). Think about it, you don't pay anything until it is sold! I guess that's why the Amazon affiliate program exists and your content is basically CPS for amazon.

### Display Advertising
Think banner ads, square adds, any ad that is on the margins of a website, or at the top/bottom of an app.

Low click-through rates because many of us are good at blanking out adds and focusing only on the content we want. Works well if contextual (fit with page) theme. Good for branding (get your colors, name, and logo out there). Works even better with retargeting (you were looking at these shoes before, well here they are again).

There are different sizes and locations on the page and hence some combinations are better than others.

Things that are tracked:
- Impressions
- Clicks
- Time of Day
- Device/OS
- Region


### Search Engine Marketing
Accounts for half of revenue of digital advertising spending. Bing, Google, Yahoo, Baidu are some examples.

You usually have a section dedicated to *paid* ads and then some *organic* links.

Ad formats usually have headline 1, headline 2, ad indicator, primary domain, description. Often these different ads are A/B tested with different versions. A lot of trial error / analytics / ad campaigns to find what works best.  

##### SERP = Search Engine Results Page
Your position on the SERP really affects your click-through rate. Usually, if you're ranked 1, you have a rate ~20% and by the time you get to 6th, you fall to ~5%.

##### Landing page = page the search engine takes you to

##### Keyword = a word found in a search query that brings a page up

#### Vickrey Auction Model
Space on the SERP has an auction model. Company A, B and C say I'll pay X, Y, Z as my most expensive ad, and hence they outbid eachother at 1cent more than the lowest spot.

Someone like google often decides through this:

$CPC MaxBid x Quality Score = AdRank/Position$


### Social Media
Everyone and their dog (literally) is on social media. Lots of eyes = lots of advertising opportunity. Some things to remember. 65% of people are visual learners. 8 seconds is the average attention span. People see 3,000 brands a day. You want to create a community. You want to have a dialogue and have others participate.
