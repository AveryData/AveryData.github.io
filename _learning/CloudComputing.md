## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, namely data and computing power. It relies on sharing of resources to solve problems at scale. Typically, these computing services (servers, databases, networking, ect) are delivered over the Internet (hence, "the cloud").

Cloud computing can be helpful as you usually pay for what you use and hence cloud computing can offer flexibility in scaling. This scaling can be due to business growth over time, peak demand at different times during the day, or even geographic locations.  Cloud computing can also be faster than local machines.


## Examples of Cloud Computing:
- This! This very site is stored in a computer somewhere and being transferred over the internet to your browser.
- Stream services to watch movies or listen to music
- Online email services (gotta store those documents somewhere)




#### Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)
A business rents servers and virtual machines, storage, networks from a cloud provider and pays as you go.

#### Platform as a service (PaaS)
Paas is the offering of: computing platform, including operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and web server. Enables the development of apps quicker by taking care of the underlying infrastrcuture of servers, storage, network, and databases.


#### Serverless Computing
The code execution is started and stopped as necessary and instead of paying by the machine or by hour, you pay as the resources are incurred. It does still indeed include servers.

#### Private Cloud
Cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single operation. It can be managed internally, or by third-party, and hosted internally or externally. These are typically more expensive as you need physical space, hardware, and other resources.

#### Public Cloud
Architecture is very similar to private cloud but services are rendered over a network that is open for public use. Some examples include AWS, IBM cloud, Oracle, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.
