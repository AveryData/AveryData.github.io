## What can Chemical Engineers do in computing?
In summary, ChemE's as classically trained, don't do a ton of data science related activities. The most common is process controls stuff. Of course they have a role in helping produce softwares like Pro2, Aspen Plus, and Aspen Hyses, but I don't think they do much from the computation stand point.

Some ChemE's are introduced to optimization in grad school and end up in a Optimization and Simulation. But usually out of undergrad, most aren't super qualified for it. But that's not to say a business wouldn't give you an optimization role out of undergrad; it is just rare.

If you've taken stats, I could see ChemE's doing statistical process control / monitoring. That's actually probably a decent area for ChemE's, but I'd say those jobs aren't super common.




## If you want to do computers in ChemE?

You could get a Grad Certificate in Data Science for the Chemical Industry at Georgia Tech. You can see the [link](https://www.chbe.gatech.edu/data-science-certificate)

University of Washington also has an Advanced Data Science Masters in Chemical Engineering [option](https://www.cheme.washington.edu/graduate_students/prosp_grad/program/ADS.html)
