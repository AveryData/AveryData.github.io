## Going To Freelancing

Can find jobs online SS
- Upwork
- LinkedIn

- Angel.co

But are you going to spend a ton of time on small projects? Are you okay with just lots of small projects? Do you want to work on something more long term? How much time are you going to spend trying to find pSrojects?

Will this scale? How to get bigger? Can you get small businesses and do a lot for them? Is this what you do for 20 years?

I would like to do data science training too.
