Six Sigma is not process improvement, it is actually problem solving. The process improvement is just a part of Six Sigma. The problems don't have to be bad, just not fully optimized. For instance, if you have a profit margin of 4%, and that's good, it could still be 5%. Often you might not think something is a process, instead you're going to think, is there a metric you want to improve or raise?


# Continuous Improvement


## DMAIC
DMAIC stands for "Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control". This was largely started by Motorola, and edited by GE.

Problems with no proven solution.

Y is the problem. X is the cause.

Good, old cause and effect analysis.

You want to lose weight, it is DMAIC.


## Lean
Lean is the removal of waste.

They're looking at non-value added steps or activity.

Want to get to work faster, it is lean.

Y is the cycle time. X is the non-value added activity.

##### Value Added Criteria
Value means it changes the thing.The customer would pay for it. Done right the first time.


## DFSS / DMADV
DFSS = Design for Six Sigma

DMADV = Define, measure, analyze, design, and verify.

Create new products, new process.

Existing has reached entitlement (reached optimized quota)

Going to buy a new truck.

Y is the customer's needs. X is the solution.

## Go Do
Updating to the latest version of a software since the one you're on now is now longer supported.

Putting a new filter in a truck because gas mileage has gone down.
