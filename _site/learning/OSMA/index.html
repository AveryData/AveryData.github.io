<p>The reason I chose to get a Master’s in Data Science really stems from choosing Chemical Engineering as my undergrad. About the end of my sophomore year  I really wasn’t sure I liked Chemcial Engineering too much. By my junior year, I was pretty sure I didn’t, and then by my senior year, I was positive I didn’t. During that process, I debated switching my major but to what? I <em>loved</em> programming.</p>
