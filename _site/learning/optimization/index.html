<h2 id="convex-sets">Convex Sets</h2>
<p>Basically if you have a shape, and you draw a line from one point in the shape, to another, the entire line should be within the shape. It also requires the set to be closed with complete boundaries.</p>

<h3 id="convex-shapes">Convex Shapes</h3>
<p>Common convex shapes include rectangular shapes in space, balls or ellipsoids, and polyhedra.</p>

<h3 id="convex-properties">Convex Properties</h3>
<p>If you take the intersection of multiple shapes, it remains a convex set. Linear combinations of convex sets, also remain convex. Finally, projections and concatenations of convex sets are also still convex sets.</p>

<h3 id="convex-function">Convex Function</h3>
<p>Convex Function: a function is convex the domain is convex and the linear combinations of two points is completely above the shape. Think like a bowl shape function. Concave functions would be the opposite, like a hill and the line is always below the function.</p>

<p>First Order Condition: At any point, draw a tangent point, then that line must be below the function.</p>

<p>Second Order Condition: Take derivative twice, the function must have an upward curvature at each point. It is also called the Hessian matrix.</p>

<p>Exponentials, powers, norms, max functions, log determinates are all examples of convex shapes.</p>

<h2 id="solving-logistic-regression">Solving Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>In logistic regression, we want to find parameters that allow for the best classification. To find these parameters, we actually use optimization.</p>
