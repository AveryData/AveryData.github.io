## Going To Freelancing

Can find jobs online
- Upwork
- LinkedIn
- Toptal
- KolabTree
- Angel.co


But are you going to spend a ton of time on small projects? Are you okay with just lots of small projects? Do you want to work on something more long term? How much time are you going to spend trying to find projects?

Will this scale? How to get bigger? Can you get small businesses and do a lot for them? Is this what you do for 20 years?

I would like to do data science training too.

Can you contract out parts of the business? The sales pitch? Or maybe even some of the analysis? Can you hire people eventually.

A complete data science company
- courses and fun projects and education serves as advertising and lands you jobs.
- You make twitter portrait stickers and send to people to try to get their business.
