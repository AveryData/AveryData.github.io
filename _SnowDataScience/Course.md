### Jason Brownlee - Master Machine Learning

Sells [books and bundles](https://machinelearningmastery.com/master-machine-learning-algorithms/)

*"The industry is demanding skills in machine learning.
The market wants people that can deliver results, not write academic papers.

Business knows what these skills are worth and are paying sky-high starting salaries.

A Data Scientists Salary Begins at:
$100,000 to $150,000.
A Machine Learning Engineers Salary is Even Higher.

What Are Your Alternatives?
You made it this far.
You're ready to take action.

But, what are your alternatives? What options are there?

(1) A Theoretical Textbook for $100+
...it's boring, math-heavy and you'll probably never finish it.

(2) An On-site Boot Camp for $10,000+
...it's full of young kids, you must travel and it can take months.

(3) A Higher Degree for $100,000+
...it's expensive, takes years, and you'll be an academic."*

# Platforms

### Podia
[Podia](https://www.podia.com/) seems like the best one. The pro is pretty affordable.
They have space for: online courses, digital downloads, webinars, and memberships. It includes the email marketing, your website, a blog, landing pages, payment portal, affiliate marketing, and messaging.

Here are some examples:

[Teachable](https://teachable.com/) is probably the most popular.

The pricing is $39, $119, and $299. They all have unlimited students. The cheapest has a 5% transaction fee.
