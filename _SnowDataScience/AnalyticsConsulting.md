To put it simply, data science consulting is the act or process of educating clients on varying aspects of data and modern technology. More specifically, consultants will build up a customer’s analytics skills, data competencies, and better structure the machinations and workings of their business.

 The issue with marketing is that this is such a niche specific industry that picking a target for marketing will often fall short, and your better off spending your time and energy becoming a trusted resource.

 Writing opportunities, speaking opportunities, running your own workshops, offering free internal workshops (or paid ones), anything that gets you up in front of groups of people helps with finding opportunities.

 Don’t be afraid to just message conferences and workshop vendors to get your name out there, you’d be surprised how many are interested!

 These include understanding and documenting the business problem (managing stakeholders), architecting and designing the solution, presenting and validating the solution with stakeholders, consistent updates and checks with project sponsors, and finally actually building it as well! It relies heavily on understanding the business process (and people) in order to effectively get through each stage.

There are of course a lot of POC (proof of concept) projects which are smaller scale, 4-6 week projects that focus on validating a concept at a small scale before moving ahead with a larger project.

From this I designed the solution and the roadmap and wrote out how their internal team would design it. I also was brought in a few more times on the project to validate and check their work, as it was not only used to build a good project but train up their internal resources for the work which was a great way to approach it.

I would have focused on key skills earlier on, instead of trying to be overly generalist, which is a difficult role in data science as near impossible to have an adequate handle on all of it at once.

Having mastery over technology concepts helps a hell of a lot but it's only half the battle, the other half is knowing how to explain them to business people and then relating that concept to a business problem they are having.

Focus on building yourself and your status with individual businesses and people first. This can be things as simple as running workshops to get business owners and people in to understand the fundamentals of data science, you can start to help people realise where it can actually fit within their business. Because you were the one to show them that, you start to become the trusted person in their mind. This means that they will approach you first then they find use cases within their businesses.

You not only want to build cool projects but generate understanding around those projects and helping to develop people's knowledge around them. This is what will get you repeat and valuable projects.

The other approach to this is the niche route, if you have a skill that not many people focus on, for example, natural language processing or a specific type of neural networks of which you have established yourself as an expert, you may have a platform to solicit specific types of projects.

one of the hardest things to show for a DS consultant is models in production, but it’s also one of the key validation points for your background. This could even be hosting an API that does something interesting with a simple website.

Look into partnerships with data firms - there are a lot of data firms (warehousing/cloud/etc.) that want to move into data science and have clients interested by can't justify hiring a full time resource. If you can show them you are a trusted recognised data scientist you may be able to come into their projects in a consultant's role.

Start reaching out and building your own network of consultants in different spaces. You’d be surprised how often you need advice from cloud experts and data engineers during the process of a data science project, and this works back and forth.



# How Would I Beat Myself?
Well, I don't have that much capital. Throwing a lot at marketing could take me out.

I also don't have that much experience...someone with years of experience is going to be much more trusted than me...but the way you get experience is you start out!

Taking more risk. Taking on more projects, hiring more people, spending more on marketing, having fancier machines.


# Charging

This reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6hp5e1/data_science_contractor_hourly_rate/) has different charging rates. The highest was $280/hour, everyone said at least $100/hour.

On Learn Data Science, this intervee [suggests](https://www.learndatasci.com/articles/how-become-data-science-consultant/) that $1000 USD/day is not uncommon. He also says "One of the things I did early on in my career is I didn’t quite recognise how much certain skills are worth and undersold myself quite a lot. "

Learn what your peers and other consultants are charging in the space, perhaps undercut them slightly (not too much, remember not to devalue your work) it may help you be competitive.
